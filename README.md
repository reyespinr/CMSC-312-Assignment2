# CMSC-312 Assignment 1

This repository contains a collection of programs demonstrating inter-process communication (IPC) methods, including message queues and socket programming.

## Structure

- `include/`: Header files for shared structures and utilities.
- `src/`: Source files for all IPC examples, including client-server socket programs and message queue examples.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.13 or higher)
- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher (e.g., g++ or clang)
- VSCode (optional, with CMake Tools extension for easy building and running)

### Using VSCode Extension

1. Open the project folder in VSCode.
2. Ensure CMake Tools extension is installed.
3. Configure the project by selecting a kit (compiler).
4. Build the project by clicking the build button (âœ“) in the bottom blue bar.
5. Run any executable by clicking on the play button next to the build button.

### Using Command Line

In the project root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build      # Create and enter the build directory
cmake ..                     # Generate build system files
cmake --build .              # Compile the project
```
To run an executable, navigate to the build directory and execute the program:

```bash
./server                     # To run the server program
./client                     # To run the client program
```
Each program can be executed in separate terminal windows. Ensure the server is running before starting the client.

## Programs by Question

- **Question 1: Basic IPC using Shared Memory**
  - `ProcessA`: Initializes shared memory and waits for B and C processes.
  - `ProcessB`: Attaches and writes to shared memory managed by Process A.
  - `ProcessC`: Attaches and writes to shared memory managed by Process A.

- **Question 2: Process Forking**
  - `SeparateForks`: Demonstrates forking separate child processes for B and C from A.
  - `NestedForks`: Demonstrates nested forking with process C forked from within B.

- **Question 3: Message Queues**
  - `Spock`: Reads messages from a message queue.
  - `Kirk`: Writes messages to a message queue.

- **Question 4: Message Queue Modification**
  - `NewSpock`: Reads a sequence of numbers from a message queue, sorts them, and prints out.
  - `NewKirk`: Sends a sequence of numbers to be sorted to `NewSpock`.

- **Question 5: Socket Programming**
  - `Server`: Sorts numbers sent by clients over sockets and prints out sorted numbers.
  - `Client`: Sends a sequence of numbers to the server to be sorted.

For more detailed instructions on running individual examples, refer to the comments within each source file.
